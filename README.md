# VoidCoin

A blockchain implementation in `python` and `django`. It builds largely on the tutorials in the resources section.

Theme by [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/superhero/)

See it in action <http://voidcoin.pythonanywhere.com/>

## Features

1. Multiple wallets per user and saving in a Django database (not recommended in a production system)
1. Signed transactions using private key
1. Node registration
1. User registration (optional). To keep things simple, registration only requires a user to provide an email (not necessarily valid, but format is important) and a unique screen name (for identification)
1. Cannot transfer more coin than you have in your wallet
1. Anybody can mine a block, but there must be at least 3 pending transactions before block can be mined.

## Views

### Home

This view shows a list of all blocks on the blockchain. A list of all signed and verified transactions that have not been added to a block are also shown

### Wallet Index

This shows a list of all wallets in the system. The wallets are stored in a Django database with the following fields

**alias:** Identifier to help a registered user differentiate between their various wallets. Must be unique for user

**owner:** The registered user who creates the wallet. Field is auto-filled for logged in user

**public_key:** The wallet address or public key

**private_key:** The wallet private key. Only the user who owns this wallet can see this key, in their dashboard

**balance:** The amount of coin balance in the wallet

### Transactions Index

This shows a list of every single transaction in the blockchain

### Nodes index

This shows a list of all registered nodes

### Account view

Shows a user's account and all the wallets they own
